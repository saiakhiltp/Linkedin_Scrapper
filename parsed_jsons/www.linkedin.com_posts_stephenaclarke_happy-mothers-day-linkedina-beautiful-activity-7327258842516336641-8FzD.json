I once told my wife, she's from Russia and also an exceptional Mom, that we ate spaghetti from a can, which she didn't believe me and on our next visit to the Grocery Store I had to show her...I loved it! \n\nI miss my Mom, still have conversations and do things that I know would make her proud. \n \nShe never cared about money and as my houses got bigger and cars fancier I could see she was happy for me and was impressed for about 5 minutes and then she was on to something else more important to her. \n\nI don't think she knew what a driving force she was for the success I had and continue to have, I always wanted to make her proud of me and still do!\n\nHappy Mothers Day to all Mothers all over the World, Mothers are special people and build strong bonds with their children.
