    "description": "I’m loving how open business leaders are becoming to a new approach to employee wellbeing.\n\nIn my 15 years in recruitment, one of the basic questions I’d ask when partnering with a new client was:\n“What does your employee benefits package include?”\n\nMost had the right intentions, offering discounted wellbeing apps, gym memberships, or flexible work options.\n\nBut what was often missing was something far more tangible and trackable:\nreal, measurable support for mental wellbeing and human performance.\n\nYes, many companies invest heavily in onboarding and job-specific training. However how often do we train people to actually think better, focus deeper, and perform at a higher level?\n\nThe next evolution of employee wellbeing isn’t just about adding more perks.\nIt’s about building cognitive capability, giving people the tools to manage pressure, think clearly, and adapt fast in a changing world.\n\nThat’s where wellbeing and performance meet, and where the future of truly people-first organisations lies.\n\n💭 How is your business approaching employee wellbeing right now? \n\nLovebrain® \n\n\n\n#EmployeeWellbeing #HumanPerformance #FutureOfWork #LeadershipDevelopment #CorporateTraining #WellbeingAtWork #PeopleFirst #PerformanceCulture #LearningAndDevelopment #CognitivePerformance",

You can train someone to optimise workflows and streamline processes, but until they can apply that to their own brain, think faster, clearer, and less bogged down by internalised restrictions, then the work will never make such of a difference.\nReal change from starting with yourself, in and out of work!",
