    "description": "AI agents are having a moment—and it’s only getting bigger. \n \nAs Nitin Mittal and I share in Forbes (https://deloi.tt/47evAU7), we’ve moved from foundational LLMs that just “chat” with data (think: generating content or code) to AI agents that can actually reason, design workflows and take action. These aren’t just smart chatbots—they’re autonomous digital workers that can process tons of data, understand context and even collaborate with each other to get complex stuff done. \n \nPicture this: Instead of the old-school, linear workflow (a team member collects data, another analyzes, and then eventually a leader makes a decision), AI agents can streamline the whole process. These digital workers can handle transactions, analyze trends, make recommendations, and even execute tasks—freeing up humans to focus on creative problem-solving and big-picture strategy. \n \nFrom Finance to Sales & Marketing to Procurement, we’re seeing that agents can have a serious impact on automating key workflows and tackling complex tasks. And that’s just the beginning - agents can also play a big role in advancing customer experience, recruitment and HR. \n \nThe bottom line: AI agents are here to help us work smarter, not harder. But trust is key—transparency, fairness, and accountability should be built in from day one. Check out our article to see how you can get started.",
