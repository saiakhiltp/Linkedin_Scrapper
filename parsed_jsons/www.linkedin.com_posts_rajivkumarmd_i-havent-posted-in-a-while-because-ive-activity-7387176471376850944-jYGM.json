    "description": "I haven’t posted in a while because I’ve been on the road meeting with more large employers to understand what’s really happening in employee wellbeing today.\n\nA consistent pattern has emerged from my conversations. Despite all the progress in this field, many leaders feel that wellbeing, as it’s currently delivered, just isn’t working anymore.\n\nHere are the five biggest themes I’ve heard:\n\n1️⃣ Intrinsic, not extrinsic.\nEmployers are tired of paying people to participate. Incentives have become transactional; the same employees engage every year while the rest tune out. Leaders want to shift the focus from financial rewards to meaning by tapping into intrinsic motivation that makes wellbeing personal and lasting (and, of course, cheaper).\n\n2️⃣ Consolidation, not fragmentation.\nMost companies now manage 20–30 point solutions across mental health, fitness, nutrition, sleep, and more. None of them talk to each other. Employees are overwhelmed, HR is exhausted, and engagement is low. The next generation of wellbeing products needs to be integrated, multi-dimensional, and easy to access.\n\n3️⃣ N of 1.\nNo more fixed, pre-designed journeys or one-size-fits-many “personas.” Employers want to meet every employee where they are, every single day, so that wellbeing feels adaptive, contextual, and deeply personal. Every individual is unique, and they each need their own wellbeing program.\n\n4️⃣ Truly global and culturally fluent.\nMultinational employers are done with “American wellbeing programs lost in translation.” They want experiences that understand local norms, languages, cultures, and values—solutions that feel as authentic in Singapore or São Paulo as they do in San Francisco.\n\n5️⃣ Bottom-up, not top-down.\nThe old model of prescriptive, centrally managed programs is fading. Employers want to empower employees to design their own wellbeing paths, to set goals that matter to them, and to pursue those goals together with colleagues.\n\nTo me, AI feels purpose-built to solve for this employer wish list.\n\nAI can understand the “why” behind someone’s goal, break it into achievable steps, and provide intelligent, real-time, and adaptive guidance that taps into intrinsic motivation. It can connect fragmented tools into a unified, personalized experience. Because they’re learning from billions of users around the world every day, LLMs can make wellbeing truly global from day one. And perhaps most importantly, AI can bring people together. It can now facilitate group dynamics, shared accountability, and peer support at a scale we’ve never seen before.\n\nMy new company, Goal AI, is building AI-native products that are responsive to these principles.

We can personalize and connect every app in the world, but if the underlying systems of work, leadership, and recovery don’t change, we’re still treating symptoms.\n\nThe real opportunity now is to design for Life Quality — aligning how work is structured, led, and funded with how humans actually function. That’s when the tech truly accelerates potential rather than compensating for system fatigue.  \n\nUntil we address the underlying infrastructure we are still playing whack-a-mole and being reactive.",
