    "description": "Mothers Day is a Hard one ……\n\nWhen does motherhood truly begin? Is it the moment you see two pink lines on a test, the day you feel that first flutter of movement, or the moment you hold your baby for the first time? For many, the answer is simple. But for women like me, who have lost countless pregnancies but cherished every moment of hope and excitement, the question is far more complex.\n\nEach time I found out I was pregnant, I believed—wholeheartedly—that this was the one. That this time, my dreams of becoming a mum would come true. And every time, that dream was taken away. Yet despite the heartbreak, I never lost the joy of those early moments. I never stopped feeling the privilege of even having that fleeting connection. There are so many women who don’t even get to experience that, and for that, I am truly blessed.\n\nSociety often sees women without children as having an easier ride. I hear it all the time—“It’s okay for her, she doesn’t have kids.” But what people don’t consider is what some of us would give not to be in that position.

Your post sounded like you felt as though you’d had only a fleeting experience of it; but the DNA of those babies will be within your genetic makeup for the rest of your life. Your babies are with you always. And to your question… motherhood begins well before any pink lines. The amount of sacrifices I made to try and become a mum made me understand what they meant about the saying that you’d lay down your life for your kids. I was doing that before they even existed! I’m so sorry for your story hasn’t been an easy one, but please know that in my eyes, you are a mummy - always x",

I always find Mother’s Day a really difficult day because one I don’t have children for a lot of reasons but would have loved to have been a mum but more importantly because I have never experienced a loving mother myself. I could say so much about the person who gave birth to me. My skin crawls when people ask me about her as she doesn’t deserve the title. It is a cruel world where so many deserve children and so many don’t. My heart is with you on this day. 💕",

I see that you take a lot of people under your wing to nourish them and help them to grow into their purpose. I have seen people to really lose sight of their purpose because of not becoming a mother. It is very hard to accept. I get that but I wish that all these women would realise they have a purpose regardless. You are an inspiration to these people.",
