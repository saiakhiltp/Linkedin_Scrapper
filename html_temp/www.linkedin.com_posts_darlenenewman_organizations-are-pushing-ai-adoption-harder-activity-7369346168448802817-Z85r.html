  <meta name="description" content="Organizations are pushing AI adoption harder than ever… yet 48.8% of employees hide their AI use to avoid judgment. Even worse? 53.4% of C-suite executives are doing the same.

And the funny part? These same companies are building AI enablement teams to &quot;drive adoption&quot;.

Does that make sense to you? Because clearly, I'm missing something.

I've been speaking with individuals across organizations, and here's what's happening…

1️⃣ Leadership declares &quot;AI is critical for our future&quot;

2️⃣ They form an &quot;AI enablement team&quot; that meets regularly with identified &quot;AI leads&quot; across organizational functions

3️⃣ They meet regularly… ask the leads about possible use cases and share parlor tricks like email summaries and basic note comparisons to drive use of the corporate &quot;chatbot&quot;

That's it. That's the playbook.

Here's the problem. Email, document review... those aren't the game-changing tasks that make a difference, like:

👉 Helping finance teams more efficiently categorize expenses

👉 Assisting marketing tap into customer data for personalized campaigns at scale

👉 Using firm legal standards to shorten contract review cycles


The enablement team can't help, not because they don't want to, but because the valuable use cases that teams actually need, while not making leadership's top 2-3 priorities, are far more complex to implement than a simple LLM driven &quot;chatbot&quot;. 

They require control of ecosystems and authority to drive change that these teams simply aren’t given responsibility for.

So what happens?

Employees think everyone else has figured out the &quot;real&quot; AI while they're stuck drafting basic documents with “ChatGPT”. 

The shame isn't in using AI… it's in how embarrassingly simple the tasks are they're using it for.

A new survey blames this widespread AI shame on lack of training, guidance, and policies.

But, they've got it backwards.

Training and guidance aren't the problem. Capability is.

What real AI enablement looks like:

✔️ Understand business problems, not just tech features (and not just the high ROI challenges) 
✔️ Document actual workflows, and the &quot;activities&quot; AI can help before recommending tools 
✔️ Create safe environments for experimentation and failure of those activities 
✔️ Provide hands-on implementation guidance, with governance support
✔️ Have authority to help drive change, not just suggest tools and generic uses 
✔️ Elevate successful use cases to program or enterprise level

This isn't about AI expertise. It's about AI enablement teams with the authority and the control of an ecosystem to drive actual transformation... not just evangelizing.

        " dir="ltr" data-test-id="main-feed-activity-card__commentary">Organizations are pushing AI adoption harder than ever… yet 48.8% of employees hide their AI use to avoid judgment. Even worse? 53.4% of C-suite executives are doing the same.

And the funny part? These same companies are building AI enablement teams to "drive adoption".

Does that make sense to you? Because clearly, I'm missing something.

I've been speaking with individuals across organizations, and here's what's happening…

1️⃣ Leadership declares "AI is critical for our future"

2️⃣ They form an "AI enablement team" that meets regularly with identified "AI leads" across organizational functions

3️⃣ They meet regularly… ask the leads about possible use cases and share parlor tricks like email summaries and basic note comparisons to drive use of the corporate "chatbot"

That's it. That's the playbook.

Here's the problem. Email, document review... those aren't the game-changing tasks that make a difference, like:

👉 Helping finance teams more efficiently categorize expenses

👉 Assisting marketing tap into customer data for personalized campaigns at scale

👉 Using firm legal standards to shorten contract review cycles


The enablement team can't help, not because they don't want to, but because the valuable use cases that teams actually need, while not making leadership's top 2-3 priorities, are far more complex to implement than a simple LLM driven "chatbot". 

They require control of ecosystems and authority to drive change that these teams simply aren’t given responsibility for.

So what happens?

Employees think everyone else has figured out the "real" AI while they're stuck drafting basic documents with “ChatGPT”. 

The shame isn't in using AI… it's in how embarrassingly simple the tasks are they're using it for.

A new survey blames this widespread AI shame on lack of training, guidance, and policies.

But, they've got it backwards.

Training and guidance aren't the problem. Capability is.

What real AI enablement looks like:

✔️ Understand business problems, not just tech features (and not just the high ROI challenges) 
✔️ Document actual workflows, and the "activities" AI can help before recommending tools 
✔️ Create safe environments for experimentation and failure of those activities 
✔️ Provide hands-on implementation guidance, with governance support
✔️ Have authority to help drive change, not just suggest tools and generic uses 
✔️ Elevate successful use cases to program or enterprise level

This isn't about AI expertise. It's about AI enablement teams with the authority and the control of an ecosystem to drive actual transformation... not just evangelizing.

So tell me, does your current AI adoption approach make sense? Let me know.</p>

        " dir="ltr" data-test-id="main-feed-activity-card__commentary">From AI Pilots to Enterprise Reality: The Readiness Gap Most Organizations Miss

78% of organizations use AI somewhere. But only 25-30% have moved beyond experimentation to truly agentic marketing workflows.

That gap isn't about technology; It's about readiness.

The Reality Check: McKinsey's State of AI (2025) shows most companies stuck in "pilot purgatory", running isolated experiments but struggling to scale agent-oriented workflows across teams.

Google Cloud's research reveals four critical gaps:

1. Data Foundations
Poor data quality, siloed systems, and weak lineage tracking. When customer data lives in 12 different systems with no single source of truth, even smart AI agents make flawed decisions.

2. Strategy &amp; Governance
Companies lack consistent AI metrics and ethical frameworks. Who owns the output when your AI agent makes a recommendation that backfires?

3. Culture &amp; Change
Resistance, fear of job displacement, and inadequate training slow transformation.

4. Talent &amp; Skills
Critical shortage of Marketing AI Strategists, Workflow Architects, and AI Ethics Officers, roles that didn't exist two years ago.

The Readiness Playbook:

1) Build Data Foundation First

-Consolidate into unified platforms (Data Lakehouse/CDP)
-Implement data quality systems before AI deployment
-Deploy metadata management for data lineage 

Example: Before deploying AI for personalization, ensure your customer data from web analytics, CRM, and email platforms can speak to each other accurately.

2) Establish Governance

-Appoint Chief AI Officer or governance committee
-Define policies for fairness, transparency, compliance
-Run regular AI output audits 

Key Question: Can you explain to a customer exactly how your AI made a specific recommendation about them?

3) Upskill Strategically

-Train executives on AI business value and risks
-Create new roles: Ethical AI Marketing Lead, Prompt Engineers, Data Stewards
-Provide hands-on training with real projects 

4)Scale with Discipline

-Start with one measurable use case (retention/personalization)
-Deploy agentic workflows with clear metrics
-Expand only after proving governance and skills 


The Bottom Line
Moving to enterprise-scale agentic marketing requires rethinking how people, processes, and technology work together. Success comes when organizations build foundational capabilities that make AI agents truly valuable.

Companies that master this won't just automate marketing, they'll reimagine human-AI collaboration across the entire customer journey.

What's your biggest readiness gap?</p>

While Tom Cruise spent two movies trying to capture and control "The Entity", most organizations are throwing themselves headfirst into AI adoption without Hunt's signature precision planning.

But here's the thing; Ethan actually left us the perfect playbook hidden in plain sight.

September's been buzzing with conversations about AI. Just in the past few weeks, we saw that MIT report on AI in Enterprise, <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/hubspot?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">HubSpot</a> launch The Flow at Inbound &amp; <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/zoominfo?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">ZoomInfo</a> + <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tdwi?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">TDWI</a> released an AI best practices research. 

At the <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/saasnxt?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">SaaSNxt</a> AI First event in Toronto, I spoke with representatives from organizations of all sizes grapple with the same challenge: how to get specific and agentic with GenAI instead of just chasing the latest shiny object. <a class="link" href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/parth-gargish-0803b897?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">Parth Gargish</a> held an engaging chat with Zak Lefvere from <a class="link" href="https://ca.linkedin.com/company/chargelab?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">ChargeLab</a> who shared thoughts on adoption &amp; <a class="link" href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/amna-jamal-46310374?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">Amna Jamal</a> from <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ibm?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">IBM</a> who made some particularly poignant points about AI governance needing to play the starring role.

Yet, there are more questions about what's next, than we have answers. 

So here's what I believe would be The Ethan Hunt approach to AI adoption. An approach that's methodical, mission-focused, and always has an exit strategy. 

🔍 Focus on the Why: Like that iconic "Your mission, should you choose to accept it" briefing in every movie. Hunt never accepts without knowing exactly what's at stake and why it matters

🎯Target An Area: Remember the laser security system in the Langley vault? Hunt didn't try to disable the whole facility, he focused on navigating exactly what mattered to get the job done

✅ Define Success: "I accept" means clear objectives before any death-defying stunts. Whether it's dangling from the Burj Khalifa or launching an AI pilot

📋 Plan for Adoption: Every Hunt mission has phases and contingencies - from the Prague Embassy infiltration to the Vatican break-in, each step builds methodically toward the goal

🛡️ Focus on AI Governance: Even when Hunt goes rogue, there are still rules of engagement and accountability. Someone's always watching

🔄 Bet on Quick Iterations: That train sequence in the first film? When Plan A fails, Hunt immediately pivots to Plan B, fixes it on the fly, and keeps the mission moving

👥 Lead by Example &amp; Have Your Team's Back: From taking the impossible climb up the Burj Khalifa himself instead of sending someone else, to literally catching Benji when he falls in Ghost Protocol Hunt never asks his team to do what he won't do first

The difference? Hunt knows that the most dangerous AI isn't the one you can't control. It's the one you deploy without understanding.

Because let's be honest our mission, should we choose to accept it, isn't to become Tom Cruise. It's to make AI work for our business without the Hollywood drama.

🚀 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗜𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝗝𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗔𝗜; 𝗜𝘁'𝘀 𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗔𝗜 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄𝘀.

We're standing at the precipice of a monumental shift. Beyond automating single tasks, AI is evolving to orchestrate entire workflows, transforming how businesses operate, innovate, and compete.

This isn't just about replacing manual steps; it's about creating interconnected, adaptive, and highly intelligent operational ecosystems.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗳𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗸 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲?

1.  𝗛𝘆𝗽𝗲𝗿-𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱 &amp; 𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: AI workflows will learn from every interaction, adapting to individual user preferences, team dynamics, and real-time business needs. Think workflows that proactively suggest the next best action, tailor content, or even optimize project timelines based on live data.
2.  𝗦𝗲𝗮𝗺𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗛𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻-𝗔𝗜 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: The future isn't AI <strong>replacing</strong> humans, but <strong>augmenting</strong> our capabilities. AI will act as an intelligent co-pilot, handling repetitive tasks, synthesizing complex data, and flagging critical insights, allowing humans to focus on strategic thinking, creativity, and high-value problem-solving.
3.  𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 &amp; 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: AI-driven workflows will anticipate challenges before they arise – predicting supply chain disruptions, identifying potential customer churn, or flagging system vulnerabilities. This shifts businesses from reactive problem-solving to proactive strategic management.
4.  𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗢𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗔𝗰𝗿𝗼𝘀𝘀 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀: Breaking down data silos will be key. AI will seamlessly integrate disparate tools  CRM, ERP, marketing automation, HRIS, etc. , ensuring data flows intelligently and actions are executed cohesively across the entire organization.
5.  𝗘𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝗜 &amp; 𝗧𝗿𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗯𝘆 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻: As AI becomes more embedded, the emphasis on explainability, fairness, and transparency in workflow design will be paramount. Building trust in these autonomous systems will be critical for widespread adoption.

The organizations that embrace this evolution will unlock unprecedented levels of efficiency, innovation, and employee satisfaction. It's about moving from "doing things faster" to "doing the <strong>right</strong> things, smarter."

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗔𝗜-𝗱𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗲𝘅𝗰𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗲𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗶𝗻𝗱𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘆? 𝗦𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 𝗯𝗲𝗹𝗼𝘄! 👇

The real opportunity is using each stage of adoption to train your employees - so they don’t just use AI, they learn how to design and govern it.

Here’s how the 𝗖𝗿𝗮𝘄𝗹 → 𝗪𝗮𝗹𝗸 → 𝗥𝘂𝗻 → 𝗙𝗹𝘆 framework works in practice:

👶 𝗖𝗿𝗮𝘄𝗹: 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀:&nbsp;Automate simple, repetitive tasks.
↳ 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲: A marketer gets a new press release. Instead of manually writing 10 social posts, they use an assistive agent to generate dozens of on-brand variations in seconds.
↳ 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗖𝗿𝗮𝘄𝗹: These tasks are simple, rules-based, and self-contained. Perfect low-risk entry points where employees start to see their work as a series of steps—and spot the repetitive ones that can be automated.
↳ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵: How to see your own work as a series of steps and spot the repetitive, rules-based tasks that can be automated. This stage builds the “automation-first” mindset.

🚶♀️ 𝗪𝗮𝗹𝗸: 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀:&nbsp;Connect AI to internal data for instant answers.
↳ 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲: Instead of asking Finance about expense report deadlines, employees query a knowledge agent connected to internal policies and get instant, sourced answers.
↳  𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵: How to ask clearer questions and validate answers. Employees learn that accuracy depends on how they query and which data sources the agent is connected to.

🏃♂️ 𝗥𝘂𝗻: 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: Execute complex tasks across multiple systems.
↳ 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲: A hiring manager says, “Onboard Matt Sobel.” The agent creates accounts, assigns equipment, and schedules training across multiple systems.
↳ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵: End-to-end workflow design—defining clear agent goals, mapping processes (triggers, handoffs, systems), and basic API literacy to understand how systems talk to each other.

🚀 𝗙𝗹𝘆: 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀: Orchestrate a "team" of agents to solve complex business problems.
↳ 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲: A supply chain disruption triggers a multi-agent system that researches alternative suppliers, models costs, and stages a new PO - ready for approval.
↳ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵: Abstract problem decomposition. Power users learn to break down complex problems (like reducing churn by 5%) into collaborative tasks that a team of agents can execute.

👉 Most companies skip straight to “Run” and burn millions. The ones that win are the ones that invest in Crawl and Walk because that’s where the real cultural shift happens.

Where is your org today - crawling, walking, running, or flying?

1. Six Lessons from Agentic AI Deployments
McKinsey analyzed 50+ enterprise agentic AI projects and distilled six lessons for capturing real value:
Workflow over agent:&nbsp;Gains come from redesigning people, processes, and technology, not just deploying AI.
Right tech at the right step:&nbsp;Focus on workflow integration, especially in multi-step processes.
Invest in evaluation:&nbsp;Regularly assess agent performance to improve outputs.
Track and verify steps:&nbsp;Ensure visibility and accountability at each workflow stage.
Reusable agents/components:&nbsp;Modular AI can cut effort by 30–50%.
Humans remain essential:&nbsp;Oversight, judgment, and handling edge cases remain critical.
Insight:&nbsp;Enterprises often fail to realize AI value without structured, iterative, and learning-focused approaches.


2. AI Leadership Blueprint
A 98-page guide from the University of Utah offering a strategic roadmap for integrating AI responsibly:
Strategic Planning:&nbsp;Consensus on AI strategy, leadership, and ROI.
Implementation:&nbsp;Readiness checks, deployment, workforce training.
Risk &amp; Governance:&nbsp;Managing risk, change, and organizational readiness.
Insight:&nbsp;Focus on durable structures and organizational readiness rather than chasing specific technologies.
3. Enterprise Software Transformation
Shift from traditional software (UI-focused) to AI-native “systems of work” (Software 3.0):
True value now lies in&nbsp;hidden orchestration logic—how AI tools sequence tasks, retrieve context, and choose the right tools.
Middleware/scaffolding&nbsp;becomes the differentiator, not the interface.
Insight:&nbsp;Future winners embed intelligence in the system architecture, not just the UX.
4. AI-Native Office Suite Trends
Andreessen Horowitz evaluated next-gen AI productivity tools across key office tasks (PowerPoint, spreadsheets, email, research, note-taking):
Gamma:&nbsp;Best visuals and user control for decks.
Genspark:&nbsp;Best for content-heavy research.
Claude (Anthropic):&nbsp;Fastest general-purpose agent, less polished visually.
Insight:&nbsp;Horizontal (all-in-one) vs. vertical (specialized) AI tools are racing to become the primary interface for work; boundaries are blurring as tools expand capabilities.



Overall Takeaways:
Enterprise value from AI comes from&nbsp;workflow redesign, evaluation, reuse, and human oversight.
Sustainable AI adoption requires&nbsp;strategy, governance, and organizational readiness.
Software is shifting from&nbsp;UI-centric to logic-centric; middleware orchestration defines competitiveness.
AI productivity tools are evolving rapidly; specialization vs. generalization is a key competitive battleground.

        " dir="ltr" data-test-id="main-feed-activity-card__commentary">McKinsey just dropped their 6 biggest lessons from a year of deploying agentic AI.

I keep pounding the drum that AI adoption isn’t a tech issue - it’s a change management issue. And for most SMBs, the mistake is starting with AI tools when they should be starting with their processes.

Here’s how the first 5 lessons translate for SMB leaders:

1. Don’t chase agents before knowing your workflows.
McKinsey’s lesson: It’s not about the agent; it’s about the workflow.
SMB takeaway: Instead of asking “What AI agent can we buy?”, ask “Where is my team bogged down by repeatable steps?”. Start by mapping workflows (e.g., onboarding, reporting, scheduling) and then layer AI where it clears friction.

2. Agents aren’t always the right tool.
McKinsey’s lesson: Simpler tech may be more effective.
SMB takeaway: Don’t overcomplicate. Sometimes a Zapier automation or spreadsheet model solves 80% of the problem. Save agents for workflows with judgment, iteration, and multiple steps.

3. Fight “AI slop.”
McKinsey’s lesson: Poor results kill adoption; treat agents like employees.
SMB takeaway: AI only builds trust if it delivers quality. Think of it like a new hire - you wouldn’t let a rookie talk to customers without training. Test and refine outputs before rolling them out company-wide.

4. Codify your team’s know-how.
McKinsey’s lesson: Turn tacit expertise into evaluation criteria.
SMB takeaway: Your best salesperson, technician, or dispatcher has instincts others don’t. Capture that knowledge in prompts and playbooks so the agent learns to work like your best employee, not just any employee.

5. Co-create with your people.
McKinsey’s lesson: Adoption depends on user collaboration.
SMB takeaway: AI fails when it’s dropped in top-down. Let the people using the workflows shape and critique it. A dispatcher, paralegal, or bookkeeper will spot friction faster than leadership ever will.

👉 The big picture: AI adoption is less about “hiring an agent” and more about re-architecting how your business runs. Get the workflows right, and the tech falls into place.</p>

McKinsey just analyzed 50+ agentic AI builds and found something that should inform every company's AI strategy.

𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝘆 𝗻𝗲𝘄 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝗳 𝗶𝘁 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸.

The winners redesign workflows first, then place AI strategically. 

It's a massive mindset shift:
❌ "What can this AI do?"
✅ "How can AI help my people do their best work?"

Four lessons McKinsey uncovered from companies getting this right:
𝟭. 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻'𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝘀𝘄𝗲𝗿
Before rushing to build an AI agent, ask: "What's the best tool for this specific task?" Sometimes rule-based automation or simple prompting works better. 

𝟮. 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗔𝗜 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘄 𝗵𝗶𝗿𝗲𝘀, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲
You can't "launch and leave." Give them job descriptions. Provide continuous feedback. Help them improve over time.

𝟯. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲, 𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲
Stop creating unique agents for every task. The best ROI comes from reusable components that eliminate 30-50% of redundant work across workflows.

𝟰. 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 "𝗔𝗜 𝘀𝗹𝗼𝗽"
When outputs are low-quality, trust disappears fast. Build monitoring into every step so you catch mistakes early and users stay confident.

The bottom line: The companies winning with AI aren't building the smartest agents. They're building the smartest collaboration between humans and AI. That's where the real value lives.

        " dir="ltr" data-test-id="main-feed-activity-card__commentary">Excellent post, <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruslan-tovbulatov?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">Ruslan Tovbulatov</a>. You've hit on the fundamental truth that technology is only as powerful as the human systems it's embedded within. The <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fmckinsey&amp;trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">#McKinsey</a> finding that "winners redesign workflows first" is a microcosm of a much larger pattern.

What you're describing with AI agents is a&nbsp;protocol failure&nbsp;at the team level. The "old protocol" is forcing a new technology (the AI agent) into a legacy workflow, creating friction and slop.

This is precisely analogous to the&nbsp;$23 Billion childcare crisis&nbsp;in New York City. 

The capital exists, but the protocols of engagement between <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fgovernment&amp;trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">#government</a>, <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fvcs&amp;trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">#VCs</a>, <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fcorporations&amp;trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">#corporations</a>, and <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Ffoundations&amp;trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">#foundations</a> are incompatible. They can't interoperate, so the value remains stranded.

Your call to "redesign work" is the&nbsp;Iverson model&nbsp;in action. Our work applies the same principle at a systemic level. We propose the&nbsp;ZYRO HIVE protocol—a meta-protocol for designing new, temporary collaborative entities ("Pods") that allow entire sectors to interoperate.

The principles are parallel:
<a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fmckinsey&amp;trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">#McKinsey</a>/ZYRO HIVE:&nbsp;"Treat AI agents like new hires." / "Treat sectoral players as co-architects with skin in the game."
<a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fmckinsey&amp;trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">#McKinsey</a>/ZYRO HIVE:&nbsp;"Build once, use everywhere." / "Create reusable collaboration protocols for different societal challenges."
<a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fmckinsey&amp;trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">#McKinsey</a>/ZYRO HIVE:&nbsp;"Transparency prevents slop." / "A shared, multi-dimensional scorecard verifies impact for all stakeholders."

The lesson is universal: whether you're integrating an AI agent into a team or a venture fund into a public good project, success depends on&nbsp;designing the interaction model first.

Your focus on the Exponential Workforce is spot on. We're exploring the same "physics of value exchange" for the Exponential Economy.

For those interested in how this thinking applies to massive, city-scale problems, I've just published a deep dive: "The $23 Billion Blind Spot: A New Protocol for the Physics of Collaboration."&nbsp;It details how a protocol-first approach can unlock stranded capital and solve systemic crises.

McKinsey just analyzed 50+ agentic AI builds and found something that should inform every company's AI strategy.

𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝘆 𝗻𝗲𝘄 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝗳 𝗶𝘁 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸.

The winners redesign workflows first, then place AI strategically. 

It's a massive mindset shift:
❌ "What can this AI do?"
✅ "How can AI help my people do their best work?"

Four lessons McKinsey uncovered from companies getting this right:
𝟭. 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻'𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝘀𝘄𝗲𝗿
Before rushing to build an AI agent, ask: "What's the best tool for this specific task?" Sometimes rule-based automation or simple prompting works better. 

𝟮. 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗔𝗜 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘄 𝗵𝗶𝗿𝗲𝘀, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲
You can't "launch and leave." Give them job descriptions. Provide continuous feedback. Help them improve over time.

𝟯. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲, 𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲
Stop creating unique agents for every task. The best ROI comes from reusable components that eliminate 30-50% of redundant work across workflows.

𝟰. 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 "𝗔𝗜 𝘀𝗹𝗼𝗽"
When outputs are low-quality, trust disappears fast. Build monitoring into every step so you catch mistakes early and users stay confident.

The bottom line: The companies winning with AI aren't building the smartest agents. They're building the smartest collaboration between humans and AI. That's where the real value lives.
