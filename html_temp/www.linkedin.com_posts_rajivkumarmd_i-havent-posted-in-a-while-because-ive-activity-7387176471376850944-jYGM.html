  <meta name="description" content="I haven’t posted in a while because I’ve been on the road meeting with more large employers to understand what’s really happening in employee wellbeing today.

A consistent pattern has emerged from my conversations. Despite all the progress in this field, many leaders feel that wellbeing, as it’s currently delivered, just isn’t working anymore.

Here are the five biggest themes I’ve heard:

1️⃣ Intrinsic, not extrinsic.
Employers are tired of paying people to participate. Incentives have become transactional; the same employees engage every year while the rest tune out. Leaders want to shift the focus from financial rewards to meaning by tapping into intrinsic motivation that makes wellbeing personal and lasting (and, of course, cheaper).

2️⃣ Consolidation, not fragmentation.
Most companies now manage 20–30 point solutions across mental health, fitness, nutrition, sleep, and more. None of them talk to each other. Employees are overwhelmed, HR is exhausted, and engagement is low. The next generation of wellbeing products needs to be integrated, multi-dimensional, and easy to access.

3️⃣ N of 1.
No more fixed, pre-designed journeys or one-size-fits-many “personas.” Employers want to meet every employee where they are, every single day, so that wellbeing feels adaptive, contextual, and deeply personal. Every individual is unique, and they each need their own wellbeing program.

4️⃣ Truly global and culturally fluent.
Multinational employers are done with “American wellbeing programs lost in translation.” They want experiences that understand local norms, languages, cultures, and values—solutions that feel as authentic in Singapore or São Paulo as they do in San Francisco.

5️⃣ Bottom-up, not top-down.
The old model of prescriptive, centrally managed programs is fading. Employers want to empower employees to design their own wellbeing paths, to set goals that matter to them, and to pursue those goals together with colleagues.

To me, AI feels purpose-built to solve for this employer wish list.

AI can understand the “why” behind someone’s goal, break it into achievable steps, and provide intelligent, real-time, and adaptive guidance that taps into intrinsic motivation. It can connect fragmented tools into a unified, personalized experience. Because they’re learning from billions of users around the world every day, LLMs can make wellbeing truly global from day one. And perhaps most importantly, AI can bring people together. It can now facilitate group dynamics, shared accountability, and peer support at a scale we’ve never seen before.

My new company, Goal AI, is building AI-native products that are responsive to these principles. We don’t have all the answers, but we do have a few visionary employers who are co-designing the future of employee wellbeing with us.

It’s an exciting time to be building at the intersection of AI and wellbeing, and I look forward to sharing more soon! | 32 comments on LinkedIn">

        " dir="ltr" data-test-id="main-feed-activity-card__commentary">I haven’t posted in a while because I’ve been on the road meeting with more large employers to understand what’s really happening in employee wellbeing today.

A consistent pattern has emerged from my conversations. Despite all the progress in this field, many leaders feel that wellbeing, as it’s currently delivered, just isn’t working anymore.

Here are the five biggest themes I’ve heard:

1️⃣ Intrinsic, not extrinsic.
Employers are tired of paying people to participate. Incentives have become transactional; the same employees engage every year while the rest tune out. Leaders want to shift the focus from financial rewards to meaning by tapping into intrinsic motivation that makes wellbeing personal and lasting (and, of course, cheaper).

2️⃣ Consolidation, not fragmentation.
Most companies now manage 20–30 point solutions across mental health, fitness, nutrition, sleep, and more. None of them talk to each other. Employees are overwhelmed, HR is exhausted, and engagement is low. The next generation of wellbeing products needs to be integrated, multi-dimensional, and easy to access.

3️⃣ N of 1.
No more fixed, pre-designed journeys or one-size-fits-many “personas.” Employers want to meet every employee where they are, every single day, so that wellbeing feels adaptive, contextual, and deeply personal. Every individual is unique, and they each need their own wellbeing program.

4️⃣ Truly global and culturally fluent.
Multinational employers are done with “American wellbeing programs lost in translation.” They want experiences that understand local norms, languages, cultures, and values—solutions that feel as authentic in Singapore or São Paulo as they do in San Francisco.

5️⃣ Bottom-up, not top-down.
The old model of prescriptive, centrally managed programs is fading. Employers want to empower employees to design their own wellbeing paths, to set goals that matter to them, and to pursue those goals together with colleagues.

To me, AI feels purpose-built to solve for this employer wish list.

AI can understand the “why” behind someone’s goal, break it into achievable steps, and provide intelligent, real-time, and adaptive guidance that taps into intrinsic motivation. It can connect fragmented tools into a unified, personalized experience. Because they’re learning from billions of users around the world every day, LLMs can make wellbeing truly global from day one. And perhaps most importantly, AI can bring people together. It can now facilitate group dynamics, shared accountability, and peer support at a scale we’ve never seen before.

My new company, <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/goalai?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">Goal AI</a>, is building AI-native products that are responsive to these principles. We don’t have all the answers, but we do have a few visionary employers who are co-designing the future of employee wellbeing with us.

It’s an exciting time to be building at the intersection of AI and wellbeing, and I look forward to sharing more soon!</p>

         comment__text babybear:mt-0.5" dir="ltr">Really thoughtful post — these are real patterns we’re all seeing.

What strikes me, though, is that many of these fixes still operate&nbsp;inside&nbsp;the same architecture that created the problem. We can personalize and connect every app in the world, but if the underlying&nbsp;systems of work, leadership, and recovery&nbsp;don’t change, we’re still treating symptoms.

The real opportunity now is to design for&nbsp;Life Quality&nbsp;— aligning how work is structured, led, and funded with how humans actually function. That’s when the tech truly accelerates potential rather than compensating for system fatigue.  

Until we address the underlying infrastructure we are still playing whack-a-mole and being reactive.</p>

With so many options available, wellbeing measurement can feel overwhelming. Where do you start?

Broadly, wellbeing metrics fall into three categories 👇

1️⃣ Subjective measures
These ask employees directly how they feel, through surveys, pulse checks, or quick “experience” sampling. They capture:

Evaluative wellbeing (job satisfaction)
Affective wellbeing (day-to-day emotions like happiness or stress)
Eudaimonic wellbeing (a sense of meaning and purpose at work)

The challenge? Survey fatigue and potential bias of taking subjective measures. Ensure people see actions as a result of completing surveys, or you could erode trust.

2️⃣ Objective measures
These draw on HR and operational data: sickness absence, turnover, retention, accidents, productivity. They’re easier to link to financial outcomes, but not perfect.

A 2024 GRiD survey found that while 82% of employers record sickness absence, only 69% track its impact, and hybrid working makes interpretation even trickier. The data’s only as strong as the system behind it.

3️⃣ Participation and engagement metrics
These track attendance at wellbeing events, use of resources, or activity within wellbeing champion networks. On their own, they don’t measure impact, but they show traction - a first step towards achieving other meaningful outcomes. 

So, where do you begin?
The goal isn’t to measure everything, but to focus on what really matters, and take the first step.

Sometimes systems don’t talk to each other, or it’s hard to directly link wellbeing to performance metrics. That’s okay. Start small:

Log wellbeing conversations happening across your organisation.
Gather feedback from events or training sessions.
Use short, validated questionnaires to track changes in job satisfaction or stress.

Remember you can’t improve what you don’t measure, so wherever you start, is a step in the right direction.

We often talk about personalization like it’s the secret code to unlock the bonus level of a video game.

In reality, it’s table stakes that just allows you to start playing. 

Real progress happens when organizations design wellbeing that aligns with culture, behavior, and daily reality.

We dove deep into real world examples at <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/integrated-benefits-institute?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">Integrated Benefits Institute</a> <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-conference-board?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">The Conference Board</a> Annual Health &amp; Productivity Forum alongside benefits leader &amp; rockstar <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anne-wright-cbp-4a52ba119?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">Anne Wright, CBP</a> during our session, “Why Personalization and Aspiration Aren’t Enough for Workplace Wellbeing.”

Here are a few nuggets that stood out 👇

💡 Design for how work really happens in your organization.

Every organization has its own flow.&nbsp;How people move, communicate, and get work done. Wellbeing succeeds when it supports that flow.&nbsp;This is why one-size-fits-all solutions don’t work.&nbsp;When programs feel like part of the flow of work, you don’t need to carve out time for wellbeing; engagement becomes natural, not forced.

💡Make health attainable, not aspirational.

People don’t need more, they need fewer barriers. Simplify access, automate where possible, and make participation effortless. Convenience drives behavior change faster than motivation alone.

💡Culture starts (and stays) with you.

Wellbeing lives in our everyday actions and behaviors.&nbsp;How leaders show up, how HR listens, how managers create space for people to recharge.  Culture isn’t what you SAY your value are, it’s what people SEE and experience daily.

💡 Care isn’t a program — it’s a practice.

True wellbeing happens in conversations &amp; connections, not campaigns. The most meaningful changes start with trust, empathy, and presence.  When care FEELS real, people buy-in and participation follows.

💡Extend care beyond the employee.

Families and dependents shape an employee’s ability to show up well at work. Supporting them creates ripple effects of stability and loyalty.  When you care for the whole household (and community) you strengthen the whole organization.

💡 Keep listening and keep adjusting.

Feedback shouldn’t be an annual event.  Continuous listening ensures programs evolve with employees, not apart from them.  Listening and taking action builds trust, and trust builds lasting engagement.

💡Use data to understand what people do — and why.

Data tells you what’s happening; empathy tells you why. Combine the two to meet employees where they are...literally, physically, emotionally, and behaviorally.  Readiness data helps you invest where motivation and impact intersect.

✨Big Finish --&gt; Personalization &amp; aspiration is necessary, but alignment is what drives sustainable change.

When wellbeing is woven into how people actually live, lead, and work, it stops being a program and starts becoming part of the culture.

𝐘𝐞𝐬, 𝐢𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐬. 

Globally, organisations are spending over $60 billion a year on wellbeing programmes, yet burnout, stress, low productivity and disengagement 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙪𝙚 to rise.

I’ve sat with countless CEOs and HR leaders over the past year, who are dumbfounded as to why their latest ‘workplace wellbeing’ programme has made little, if any difference, to the wellbeing of their employees.

Why?

Because  workplace wellbeing is 𝒏𝒐𝒕 designed to transform systems; it’s designed to make people more resilient to broken ones.

The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting a different result. Yet organisations continue to spend thousands of dollars on workplace wellbeing programs by 'experts' who promise to transform burnout into high performance, with little, if any, scientific evidence to back-up their claims—but they have thousands of followers on social media so they must be an expert, right? 

We don’t need more workplace wellbeing programs, we need conscious organisations that understand their systemic organisational issues can 𝒐𝒏𝒍𝒚 be solved by programs that are grounded in psychology, behavioural science, and neurobiology. Without that foundation, interventions risk being superficial at best, and harmful at worst.

It's time to not only regulate the workplace wellbeing industry, it's also time to stop peddling the myth that breath work, happiness, lifestyle hacks, or any of the other 'initiatives' make a meaningful difference to employees or the organisations they work in. They don't, and the data is robust and very clear on that.

The future of work does not belong to organisations who spend the most on workplace wellbeing. The future of work belongs to organisations who evolve from treating symptoms, to transforming systems.

It means managers need upgraded skills and tools, along with systemic support and accountability. And it means that organisations need to treat wellbeing and mental health as a core component, integrated into all decisions and analysed with the same rigor as financial, technological or security issues.

As Deloitte’s first Chief Wellbeing Officer, <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jen-fisher-cwbo?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">Jen Fisher</a> shares what she has learned about implementing wellbeing as a core strategic priority – it’s a fascinating read and holds key lessons for any organisation. Two of her points resonated with my experience in this work:

✨ Culture Eats Strategy (and Wellness Programs) for Breakfast: 
In the NGO world, it might look like continuing to hail the “tireless and selfless advocate” while saying that rest is important. We need to shift the narrative and look for restorative and supportive practices for individuals and teams to share and inspire each other. Combining this with measuring and showing how improved practices have also allowed creativity, problem solving and improved relations with partners or others allows for particularly strong alternative narratives which can help shift unhealthy cultural mores.
&nbsp;
✨ Wellbeing Requires Both Systemic Change and Individual Responsibility: Initiatives that simply ask individuals to become more “resilient” don’t get to the systemic issues and won’t work. But if individuals are not empowered with awareness, tools and responsibilities – no systems will be sufficient either. Adding to <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jen-fisher-cwbo?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">Jen Fisher</a>’s point here, I would add the importance of teams and other groups within the organisation. Colleagues and communities are where much wellbeing and mental health support begin and end. Science shows we need each other to thrive – making this a systemic priority is essential.  

Wellbeing and mental health are not just an add-ons or nice-to-have. It’s core for any organization. It's about people and it's about what we're here to do. 🌿

Wellbeing in the workplace stretches far beyond how your employees feel. It shapes everything from the energy and productivity they bring to their work, how they interact with others, and even, how your company performs.&nbsp;

The research and data is clear. Wellbeing is a leading indicator of company success:
- Performance: At British Telecom, employees who reported greater happiness at work had 12% higher weekly sales.&nbsp;
- Talent attraction: In data from Indeed, a single point increase in company wellbeing score translated to a 1.3% increase in job applications, meaning greater wellbeing leads to greater talent attraction.&nbsp;
- Turnover: The top 100 certified Great Places to Work had two thirds less turnover than average.
- Revenue per employee: The top 100 certified Great Places to Work on average have revenue per employee that is 8.5 times higher than the U.S. market
- Valuation: Greater employee wellbeing was found to be tied to higher company valuation and return on assets, and greater profits, across 1800 publicly traded U.S. companies.
- Stock performance: Companies with higher levels of employee wellbeing outperformed on the stock market against the S&amp;P 500, Russell 3000 Index, and Nasdaq Composite. The 100 Best Companies outperform the S&amp;P 500 by more than 2,000%

And at a global level, improving workplace wellbeing could help the global economy grow by $11.7 trillion, according to the World Economic Forum's Thriving Workplaces report.

The research found variations between departments and geographies within companies, not just company-to-company or industry-to-industry. It also found that it’s largely the social elements that make wellbeing stick: being treated well, feeling supported, and having meaningful work connections.&nbsp;

All this confirms what we know from our own research and conversations. Wellbeing stretches beyond company memos and initiatives. It’s built, in the flow of the workday, by managers and teammates.&nbsp;

Workers don’t want wellbeing to be another task to check off, time commitment, or tool to learn. Instead, they want simple, quick, and effective tools that take place where they need them most: in the flow of the workday. Something that they can build momentum on with others.&nbsp;

Encouragement, role modeling, and shared participation are the drivers that make all the difference. Just 2-mins can make a big difference to how workers feel, by shifting mood, boosting energy, and building connections, all while creating a more productive and engaged workforce.&nbsp;

This is what Breakthru is for. 2-min breaks, in the flow of the workday, inside your existing tools. Designed to be shared with others.&nbsp;&nbsp;

People rarely quit because of the paycheck.
They quit because of the pressure.

Not the kind that comes from hard work,
but the kind that comes from being unheard, unseen, and overstretched.

It’s what happens when wellbeing becomes a “nice-to-have” instead of a non-negotiable.

👉 Skipped lunches that turn into skipped weekends.
👉 Work messages that never stop.
👉 Wellness programs that exist only in PowerPoints.

That’s how great employees fade out — not because they lack resilience,
but because the system they’re in lacks empathy.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth leaders often overlook:

1️⃣ Wellbeing isn’t fluff, it’s foundation.
 → Without it, performance cracks under pressure.

2️⃣ Burnout doesn’t come from doing too much.
 → It comes from caring too long without support.

3️⃣ Rest isn’t the opposite of productivity.
 → It’s what fuels it.

4️⃣ People don’t walk away from hard work.
 → They walk away from cultures that make it harder.

5️⃣ The wellbeing crisis isn’t about resources.
 → It’s about responsibility.

Every time you deprioritize wellness, you don’t just lose engagement, you lose trust, energy, and your future leaders.

So ask yourself:
 💭 Culture or cost?
 Because in the end, you’ll always pay for both, the question is how.

And that’s exactly what we’ll unpack in our next live session:
 🎙 “Culture or Cost? Why Neglecting Wellbeing Today Risks Losing Your Top Talent Tomorrow.”

🧠 Why now is the time to be proactive about workplace wellness

In a recent article for Personnel Today, Jo Faragher calls on employers to shift from reactive to preventive when it comes to health and wellbeing. The piece highlights how rising sickness absence is no longer just a cost to businesses it’s a signal that our approach to worker wellbeing needs rethinking.  

Key take-aways include:
	•	Many wellbeing programmes remain under-utilised because employees don’t know how to access them.  
	•	Barriers like requiring GP referrals or manager sign-off slow down care at critical moments.  
	•	Building a culture of openness (on mental health, menopause, long-term conditions) is as essential as providing services.  
	•	A proactive health/wellbeing strategy isn’t just “nice to have” it makes financial sense, especially when absence levels are climbing.  

At FOHN, we believe occupational health professionals are vital to helping organisations make this shift.

💬 :
In your own practice or organisation, what encourages or challenges the creation of a genuine culture of wellness? Where do you see opportunities for occupational health to lead this change?

According to Wellhub’s annual workplace wellness survey, employee well-being fell 9% from last year — just 54% report feeling good overall.

Meanwhile, 90% say they experience burnout, 53% feel more stressed, and most admit sustained energy and focus are out of reach.

But priorities are shifting.

 → 86% of workers now value well-being as much as salary.
 → 82% are intentionally working less to find balance.
 
The great escape.

→ 91% of employees recharge at gyms, wellness clinics, or run clubs.
→ One-third cited community as their top motivator. 
→ Most use wellness apps to track performance and stay accountable.

The workplace gap.

Despite broad agreement that well-being drives job performance, only 14% have access to structured wellness programs — a 21% satisfaction gap.

Over half say their expectations have risen since last year, but fewer than 30% rate their current benefits as good.

Workplace wellness is nonnegotiable. Employees are doing the work, but most employers still haven’t caught up.

📉 Employee well-being is falling: just 54% feel good overall, down 9% from last year. Burnout is at 90%, stress up 53%, and sustained focus is out of reach for most.

→ Priorities are shifting: 86% of employees now value well-being as much as salary
→ 82% are intentionally working less to protect balance

The great escape: 91% recharge at gyms, wellness clinics, or running clubs. One-third cite community as their top motivator, and wellness apps help track progress and stay accountable.

The workplace gap: only 14% have structured wellness programs — leaving a 21% satisfaction gap. Over half say expectations have risen, but fewer than 30% rate benefits as good.

How LifeNome helps companies close the gap:

→ We enable brands to offer Longevity OS™ to employees and clients — a complete wellness platform integrating genetics, lifestyle, biomarkers, and actionable health insights.
→ Employees get personalized guidance to improve energy, focus, and long-term health, while companies see measurable results: higher engagement, better productivity, stronger retention, and a culture that truly supports well-being.

LifeNome works with companies to create tailored programs: community wellness challenges, performance tracking, personalized coaching, and digital health dashboards — all integrated into the workplace. This isn’t just a perk — it’s a strategic advantage. Employees thrive, clients benefit, and brands stand out as leaders in health-forward culture.

💡 The future of work is clear: wellness drives performance. Companies that partner with LifeNome don’t just keep up — they lead, offering Longevity OS™ as a tool to empower every individual in their ecosystem.

According to Wellhub’s annual workplace wellness survey, employee well-being fell 9% from last year — just 54% report feeling good overall.

Meanwhile, 90% say they experience burnout, 53% feel more stressed, and most admit sustained energy and focus are out of reach.

But priorities are shifting.

 → 86% of workers now value well-being as much as salary.
 → 82% are intentionally working less to find balance.
 
The great escape.

→ 91% of employees recharge at gyms, wellness clinics, or run clubs.
→ One-third cited community as their top motivator. 
→ Most use wellness apps to track performance and stay accountable.

The workplace gap.

Despite broad agreement that well-being drives job performance, only 14% have access to structured wellness programs — a 21% satisfaction gap.

Over half say their expectations have risen since last year, but fewer than 30% rate their current benefits as good.

Workplace wellness is nonnegotiable. Employees are doing the work, but most employers still haven’t caught up.

The issue isn't that wellbeing initiatives don't matter - it's that we've been putting the responsibility in the wrong place. We've been asking individuals to be more resilient, to cope better, to manage their stress - when the real work is designing organisations that don't deplete people in the first place.

Workplace wellbeing isn't about what we add on top of work. It's about whether the work itself - job design, workload, psychological safety, leadership, supports people's fundamental human needs or undermines them.

If you've seen organisations get this right (or wrong), I'd love to hear what you've observed. What does good actually look like in practice?

The most impactful wellbeing efforts address job design, workload, leadership styles, policies, and normative practices along with offering programs and resources that support skill building and healthy lifestyles. 

For more details on how to design more effective workforce wellbeing initiatives, check out this article by <a class="link" href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/caitlin-guilfoyle?trk=public_post_reshare-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post_reshare-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">Caitlin Guilfoyle</a>, a member of the <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/workplace-wellbeing-initiative/?trk=public_post_reshare-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post_reshare-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">Workplace Wellbeing Initiative of the Global Wellness Institute</a>.
